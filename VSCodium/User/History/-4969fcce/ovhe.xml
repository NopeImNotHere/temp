  Security is a number from 0 to 5 that represents how hard it is to hack
  From 1-4 it will need that many ports to open, 4 and above will automatically
  add other security to scale it up easily, you can overwrite specifics below (recommended)
  
  AllowsDefaultBootModule is default to true and means that when you connect to a node
  it will automatically launch it's program (the last daemon defined in this file) and
  put it up on the display module.
  Because this example computer shows off a lot of stuff, I've set this to false here.

  Progress admins reset ports, firewall and proxy progress, but only if the player isn't the admin.
  Super admins reset passwords instantly on fast mode
  
  for servers that insta-reset whenever you disconnect use:
  admin type="fast" resetPassword="true" isSuper="true"
  
  for general computers, it's best practice to use a progress admin unless you want port changes to persist between disconnects.
  admin type="progress"
  
  For computers that have the "security" number in the header set to more than 4, remove the auto-added admin with this:
  admin type="none"
